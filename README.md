## 🚀 Getting Started

### Option 1: Current Setup (Client-Side Only)
1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

2. **Access the application:**
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`
   - Register a new account at `http://localhost:8000/register.html`
   - Login with your credentials

### Option 2: MySQL Integration (Recommended)

#### Prerequisites
- MySQL Community Server (free)
- Node.js (for backend API)
- npm or yarn

#### Database Setup
1. **Install MySQL:**
   - Download from: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/
   - Or use XAMPP: https://www.apachefriends.org/

2. **Run the database script:**
   ```sql
   -- Execute database-setup.sql in MySQL
   -- This creates the database, tables, and sample data
   ```

3. **Install backend dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Configure database connection:**
   - Update `dbConfig` in `server.js` with your MySQL credentials
   - Set up environment variables for production

5. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. **Update frontend API calls:**
   - Replace localStorage operations with API calls
   - Use the provided `api.js` service
